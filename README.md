TODO: add more information about the project, contributing, workflow...

This is the LaIR queue web app's implementation. It is a statically served frontend web application
written in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Run dev server

Run this command (without the $):

```bash
$ npm start
```

Open your browser, go to `localhost:8000`. Voila!

## Run tests

```bash
$ npm test
```

## Write tests

TODO: move to wiki

### Jest

The tests are written using the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) testing framework. Jest
mocks out any `require()`'d dependencies automatically, so that you test your React components in
isolation. Otherwise, the structure and expectations available work similarly to any other BDD
testing framework, like Mocha or Cucumber.

### React.addons.TestUtils

To simulate interactions with React components, get familiar with [React's test
utilities](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html). More detailed explanations will
be posted later as contributions ramp up.

## Happy contributing!
